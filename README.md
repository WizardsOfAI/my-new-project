# Painting with AI

Building AI course project

## Summary

I'll morph images with AI


## Problems it will solve

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this:
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

## Challenges

What could go wrong? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## Data sources
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

## What next?

What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on? How finished should the solution be in order to be good enough?

## Missing from this template

* more formatting options: code blocks
* how to add files, images, code
